This is a mock UI for contribution to the Outreachy Program.
The goal is to create a webapp that has the ability to find and provide
users the means to edit tools with missing fields.

I used the create react app for this frontend code and my structure
involves 3 pages. Home, Dashboard and Leaderboard.
I used a component I had created from my practice website for the nav bar after a little upgrade to it.

I installed font awesome from 'https://fontawesome.com/icons' and this I used for adding icons to my buttons.
I imported browser router on App.js to facilitate smooth browsing through the mock pages on Ui.
